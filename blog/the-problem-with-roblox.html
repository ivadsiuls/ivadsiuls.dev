            Recently, my friend (Enginefour) went on a rant about the problems with Roblox as a whole, and how he was fed up with the way the platform
          treats its users and developers. So, I'd like to share what he said, and my own opinion on it.

        <h2>The <i>good</i> side of Roblox</h2>
        <p>
            Roblox has a lot of problems, but before we get to that, we must see the pros of Roblox.
          Roblox has many good properties, but the main ones are:
        </p>
        <br>

        <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
          <li>
            Easy to play games
          </li>
          <li>
            Free games
          </li>
          <li>
            Easy scripting language
          </li>
          <li>
            Free servers
          </li>
          <li>
            Customizable avatar across multiple games / UGC
          </li>
        </ul>
          
        <br>
        <p>As you can see, what attracts players (mostly children) and developers alike to Roblox is:</p>

        <h2>How Roblox requires your game to be <i>pay to win</i></h2>

        <cite>
          "I wish Roblox was better.
          They don't care about their developers,
          you need to fill your game up with micro-transactions for sustainable income."
        </cite>
        <br>
        <p>
            Roblox actively makes it so you can't succeed on the platform if you don't fill your game up with hundreds of micro-transactions. If you don't?
          Too bad. Either make a donation button where you'll likely receive almost zero Robux, or pray that the money from premium payouts cover the costs
          of advertising, paying developers, and sustaining your own life off of it. Roblox is a multi-billion dollar corporation, they can do better.
        </p>
        <hr class="line"/>
        <h2>You earn practically nothing</h2>

        <p>
          Even with Roblox taking a 30% cut of everything you do on the platform, they still think it's fair to only give you about
          30% of your money when you try to DevEx. Because of that, some developers instead sell their Robux on black markets, and I don't even blame them.
          As I said, It's a multi-billion dollar mega corporation. They don't have to suck every single dollar out of our wallets.
        </p>

        <hr class="line"/>
        <h2><i>"Your safety is <b>not</b> our problem"</i></h2>

        <p>
          I believe everyone reading this knows that Roblox moderation <i>does not give a fuck.</i>
          I truly believe that those support.roblox.com tickets don't even get sent to them. Theres no way they can be <i>that</i> <b>incompetent.</b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Roblox creates a place where pedophiles are welcome, and rewarded for their behavior. They've been hit with <b>many, many</b> lawsuits, and
          it's all because they create a place where children can be groomed. The pedophile can go to jail, but when they get out, their Roblox account
          will be waiting for them, completely untouched, just waiting for them to do the exact same thing again. The only times Roblox actually enforces
          their moderation is when their stock is going down as a result of it.
        </p>

        <hr class="line"/>
        <h2><i>If</i> they cared</h2>

        <p>
          In this <b>hypothetical</b>, let's assume Roblox <b>did</b> care, they <b>did</b> listen to the community, they <b>did</b> reward their developers,
          they <b>did</b> protect children. Roblox would be blooming with hundreds of actually talented creators, good features, and a player base that doesn't
          consist of indonesian kids at internet cafes playing grow a garden. I might argue Roblox would be even more popular than it is now. Roblox <b>wouldn't</b>
          be summed up to <i>"that one game for children"</i>. 
        </p>

        <hr class="line"/>
        <h2>The <i>breaking point</i></h2>

        <p>
          Recently, Roblox announced that after <b>5 long years</b>, they'll finally be bringing back the <b>egg hunts</b>. For most people, it was a big shock,
          everyone thought after the "Metaverse Champions" event, egg hunts wouldn't be a thing anymore. Everyone had high hopes, it seemed like Roblox
          was actually caring for their community, they were sending eggs to content creators, and sending cryptic messages.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
          A ERP game developer was caught in the official private event game for the event, and it's been confirmed that they're also inside the private
          discord for the event as well.
        </p>
